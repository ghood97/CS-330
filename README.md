## How do I approach designing software?
#### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  This work on my project has helped to increase my knowledge of C++ and pointers. I feel more comfortable designing C++ programs using C++ conventions.
#### What design process did you follow for your project work?
  The design process that I followed for my project work was one where I slowly developed small parts of software at one time. I would create a an object per day   or something similar to make sure I wasn't getting lost in the code.
#### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  I think the tactics that I used when writing the C++ code will be helpful in the future if I ever need to work in C++ again, especially in my career.

## How do I approach developing programs?
#### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  A new development strategy that I used while working on the 3D scene is logging. Logging results of what was happening in the program was very helpful when       trying to identify errors.
#### How did iteration factor into your development?
  Iteration was a big part of my development. I iterated over the same process multiple times to create multiple different shapes. This process was the same for each shape, only th evertex data changed.
#### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  After each milestone, I realized that I really needed to study the tutorial code in order to understand it fully and implement it myself in my project.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Computational graphics gave me the knowledge and skills that I needed to fully understand linear algebra and matrix operations. Before this course, those topics seemed very abstract but make some more sense.
#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  If I ever wanted to work in Computational Graphics, I now have the knowledge to get started. This project is a great starting point for learning more about 3D visualization and OpenGL as a whole.
